- what is cybersecurity? <br>
  Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative
- What are the common cyberattacks?
 Below are some of the most common types of cyber-attacks:
👉 Malware.
👉 Phishing.
👉 Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)
👉 Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack.
👉 SQL injection.
👉 Zero-day exploit.

- Difference between ifconfig &ipconfig?
- What is data encapsulation in networking? <br>
  Encapsulation is the process of adding additional information when data is traveling in OSI or TCP/IP model. The additional information has been added on sender's      side, starting from Application layer to Physical layer
- What are black box and white box testing?
- How is encryption is different from hashing?
   encryption is two-way, the data can be decrypted so it is readable again. Hashing, on the other hand, is one-way, meaning the plaintext is scrambled into a unique        digest, through the use of a salt, that cannot be decrypted.
- What is a three way handshake?
- Explain SSL Encryption.
  SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and, in short, it's the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is    being sent between two systems, preventing criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including potential personal details.<br>
   Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is a security protocol that is used for the purpose of encryption. It ensures privacy, data integrity, and authentication in the network like   online transactions.<br><br>
  Following are the steps for setting up an SSL encryption: 
  - A browser connects to an SSL-secured web server. 
  - The browser requests the server’s public key in exchange for its own private key. 
  - If it is trustworthy, the browser requests to establish an encrypted connection with the web server. 
  - The web server sends the acknowledgment to start an SSL encrypted connection. 
  - SSL communication starts to take place between the browser and the web server.
- What is a firewall? Mention its uses.
- What is the CIA triad?

- Explain data leakage.
  The unauthorized transmission of data from an organization to any external source is known as data leakage. This data can be leaked physically or electronically via   hard drives, USB devices, mobile phones, etc., and could be exposed publicly or fall into the hands of a cyber criminal.
- Explain SSL & TLS
  SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer while TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. Both Secure Socket Layer and Transport Layer Security are the protocols used to     provide security between web browsers and web servers.
- What are salted hashes?
 Salting hashes sounds like one of the steps of a hash browns recipe, but in cryptography, the expression refers to adding random data to the input of a hash function   to guarantee a unique output, the hash, even when the inputs are the same.
- Difference between VPN & VLAN
 VPN:A VPN is a virtual private network that utilizes a public network (usually the Internet) to connect remote sites or users together. A typical VPN network has a   main local area network (LAN) at the corporate headquarters of a company, other LANs at remote offices or facilities, and individual users that connect from out in the  field.
 VLAN:A VLAN is a group of networking devices configured to communicate on one or more LANs as if they were attached to the same wire, but actually they are located on a number of different LAN segments. VLAN networks are based on logical instead of physical connections with great flexibility. A VLAN network defines broadcast domains in a Layer 2 network.

## DevOps Interview Questions

- What do you know about DevOps?
  DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high            velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.
- What is the role of AWS in DevOps?
  AWS provides services that help you practice DevOps at your company and that are built first for use with AWS. These tools automate manual tasks, help teams manage      complex environments at scale, and keep engineers in control of the high velocity that is enabled by DevOps.
- How is DevOps different from agile methodology?
   DevOps is a culture, fostering collaboration amongst all participants involved in the development and maintenance of software. Agile can be described as a             development methodology designed to maintain productivity and drive releases with the common reality of changing needs.
- What are the different phases in DevOps?
 DevOps follows certain processes that include code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor and plan. DevOps lifecycle follows various phases such as   continuous development, integration, testing, continuous monitoring, and continuous feedback.
- How will you approach a project that needs to implement DevOps?
- What is the difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment?
  Continuous Delivery (CD): CI + the entire software release process is automated, it may be composed of multiple stages, and deployment to production is manual.         Continuous Deployment: CI + CD + fully automated deployment to production.
- What is the role of configuration management in DevOps?
  Configuration management is important because it enables the ability to scale infrastructure and software systems without having to correspondingly scale                 administrative staff to manage those systems. This can make it possible to scale where it previously wasn't feasible to do so.
- What are the fundamental differences between DevOps & Agile?
